I see you walking hand in hand with long-haired drummer of the band,
In love with her or so it seems, he's dancing with my beauty queen,
Don't even dare to say you hi, still swallowing the goodbye,
But I know the feelings still alive, still alive.
I lost my patience once, so do you punish me now,
I'll always love you, no matter what you do,
I'll win you back for me if you give me a chance,
But there is one thing you must understand.
